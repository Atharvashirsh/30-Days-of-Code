## Problem Statement
Emily was playing with triplets. She was excited to find out how many triples of non-negative integers (a, b, c) satisfy a+b+c≤S and a×b×c≤T, where S & T are non-negative integers.
## Input
The input line contains S, and T separated by space.

## Constraints
> 0 ≤ S ≤ 100 <br>
> 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000 <br>

S and T are integers.
## Output
Print the number of triples of non-negative integers (a, b, c) satisfying the conditions.
## Example
### Sample Input 1
> 1 0

### Sample Output 1
> 4

### Sample Input 2
> 2 5

### Sample Output 2
> 10

### Sample Input 3
> 10 10

### Sample Output 3
> 213

`In example 1,the triplets are (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0) and (1,0,0)`
