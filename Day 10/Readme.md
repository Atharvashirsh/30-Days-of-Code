## Problem Statement
There are A Bacterias.<br>
Each time Jerry shouts, the bacterias multiply by K times.<br>
In order to have B or more slimes, at least how many times does Jerry need to shout?
## Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
> A B K

## Constraints
> 1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 10<sup>9</sup><br>
> 2 ≤ K ≤ 10<sup>9</sup><br>

`All values in input are integers.`
## Output
Print the answer.
## Example
### Sample Input 1
> 1 4 2
### Sample Output 1
> 2

### Sample Input 2
> 7 7 10
### Sample Output 2
> 0

### Sample Input 3
> 31 415926 5
### Sample Output 3
> 6

`In first case, after the first shout Jerry will have 2 bacteria and after the second shout, he will have 4(2*2) bacteria.`
