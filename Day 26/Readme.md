# Problem Statement
We have A cards, each of which has an integer 1 written on it. Similarly, we also have B cards with 0s and C cards with −1s.<br>
We will pick up K among these cards. What is the maximum possible sum of the numbers written on the cards chosen?
## Input
The input consists of 4 space separated integers as follows :
> A B C K

## Constraints
> 0 ≤ A, B, C <br>
> 1 ≤ K ≤ A+B+C ≤ 2×10<sup>9</sup>

`All values in input are integers.`
## Output
Print the maximum possible sum of the numbers written on the cards chosen.
## Example
### Sample Input 1
> 2 1 1 3
### Sample Output 1
> 2

### Sample Input 2
> 1 2 3 4
### Sample Output 2
> 0

### Sample Input 3
> 2000000000 0 0 2000000000
### Sample Output 3
> 2000000000
