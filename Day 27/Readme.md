## Problem Statement
You are given an integer N. Do the following operation K times on it and print the resulting integer.<br>
If N is a multiple of 200, divide it by 200. Otherwise, see N as a string and append 200 to the end of it.<br>
For example, 7 would become 7200, and 1234 would become 1234200.
## Input
The input consists of two space separated integers as follows:
> N K

## Constraints
`All values in input are integers.`
> 1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>5</sup><br>
> 1 ≤ K ≤ 20
## Output
Print the answer as an integer.
